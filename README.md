I needed to compile a public list of projects to demonstrate expertise in certain areas. However, 
I couldn't include the majority of my work that is either associated with the Department of Defense or currently in use at my company. 
Therefore, this list consists of personal projects that are either no longer active or not connected to government or corporate work.
